# EX2-JS

We have created a database using the PhpMyAdmin tool with the following fields firstname, lastname, login, and password. For the web pages, we will need the following pages :
- registration.php: which allows the user to create an account. This page contains a form with the fields: firstname, lastname, login, password, password confirmation and a submit button.
-login.php: which authenticates the user. It contains a form with a text zone, a password zone and a submit button.
- session.php: which represents the limited access page. No visitor has the right to see its content if he has not been authenticated by the login.php page.
- deconnexion.php: is the page that allows to disconnect the client (destroy the session) and redirect the browser to the login.php page.
- connection.php: which contains the connection string.
